- [Go + Open Telemetry](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/tree/main/examples/quick-start-grpc-stream-propagation): code based in a [article](https://dev.to/kubeshop/opentelemetry-trace-context-propagation-for-grpc-streams-4511) that show a producer and consumer based in gRPC streams written in Go
- [Node.js + DDD](https://github.com/danielbdias/domain-driven-design-in-nodejs): example Express.js written in Node.js showing an interpretation of applying some Domain Driven Design principles in a code.
- [Ruby + DDD](https://github.com/danielbdias/domain-driven-design-in-ruby): example of Ruby on Rails app showing an interpretation of applying some Domain Driven Design principles in a code.
- [SRE + Observability stack](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/tree/main/examples/observability-stack): example based in this [article](https://dev.to/kubeshop/building-an-observability-stack-with-docker-3de8) on how to build a local observability stack to test observability for you app.
